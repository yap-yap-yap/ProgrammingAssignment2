# Programming Assignment 2

**How to run**

1. Make sure the working directory is the source directory i.e. ``your/own/directories/ProgrammingAssignment2``. 
2. Compile the client and server files in the version of the program that you want to run.

> Example:
> 
> To compile ``WithCP2``, run ``javac WithCP2/ServerWithCP2.java`` and ``javac WithCP2/ClientWithCP2.java``.
> 
3. In separate terminals (both in the source directory!!), run the server and then run the client.
> Example:
> 
> To run ``WithCP2``, run ``java WithCP2/ServerWithCP2`` in one terminal instance, and ``java WithCP2/ClientWithCP2`` in another.
> 
4. The client script will ask for the filename of the file that you wish to transfer. Place the file you wish to transfer in ``input-files`` and enter the filename into the terminal. The transferred file will be in ``received-files``.

5. To terminate the connection, enter ``exit()``.

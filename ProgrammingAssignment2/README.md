**How to run**

Compile the project, and make sure the working directory is this source directory (``your/own/directories/ProgrammingAssignment2/``). Place the files that you want to transfer in ``input-files``. Start the server, then the associated client (same authentication/confidentiality protocol). The client script will prompt the user to input the filename of the file in ``input-files``. Once sent, the output will be in ``received-files``.
